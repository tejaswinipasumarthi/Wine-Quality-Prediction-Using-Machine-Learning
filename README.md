# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting wine quality—categorized as Good, Average, or Bad—using its physicochemical attributes. Machine learning models are trained and tested on the Wine Quality dataset, leveraging feature engineering and ensemble methods to achieve strong predictive performance.


# 1) Project Overview

- Predicts wine quality labels: Good, Average, or Bad
- Leverages ensemble learning (Random Forest + Gradient Boosting) for reliable performance
- Balances imbalanced data using SMOTE
- Applies Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature optimization
- Uses weighted probability ensembles to combine model outputs
- Provides a simple user interface via terminal input for custom predictions
- Outputs probability scores for each class along with user-friendly feedback

# 2) Tools & Methodologies

- Languages/Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- ML Frameworks: Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Optimization: GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Techniques: SMOTE (oversampling), RFE (feature selection)
- Development: Jupyter Notebook
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

# 3) Key Achievements

- Reached ~99% accuracy on test data with ensemble methods
- Designed a real-time input system for prediction
- Visualized class imbalance and its correction using SMOTE
- Stored trained models with joblib for future reuse

# 4) Usage Instructions

- Clone/download the repository
- Run the Jupyter Notebook or .py file
- Enter wine property values when prompted
- Get instant predictions with probability breakdown

# 5) Sample Input Features

- For simplicity, only the most relevant features are taken as input. Remaining features default to zero.

# 6) Project Status

- Course Project (Sept 2024 – Dec 2024)
